# About Python
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python’s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

# Applications for Python
Python is used successfully in thousands of real-world business applications around the world, including many large and mission critical systems. Although the applications for Python are numerous they can be broadly categorized into:

- Web and Internet Development
- Scientific and Numeric Computing
- Education
- Desktop Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- Software Development

Python is a great programming language because of the ff reason, but not limited to:
- Python is a dynamic-typed language; you don’t have to explicitly state that a variable is an integer number, for example. The Python interpreter will figure that out.
- Python is interpreted, meaning it is ran “on-the-fly”. This makes it very easy to write and test programs. Many other languages are compiled to machine code before they will run; this makes them run faster than Python, but for most things you won’t notice it.
- Python allows you to use procedural programming (via functions) or object-oriented programming (via classes). Some other languages make you use one or the other.
- Python has built-in data structures, such as lists and dictionaries, so you don’t have to create these structures from scratch. It also handles memory management for you.
- Whitespace in Python is significant. Code blocks are delineated using indentation rather than special symbols.

# Who use Python
- Google - Python is one of the key language used in google.
- Philips - Philips uses Python for the sequencing language ( language that tells what steps each robot should take ).
- Frequentis - Frequentis is the originator of TAPTools, a software product that is used for air traffic control in many airports. This particular tool provides updates on the weather and runway conditions to air traffic controllers. So, you depend on Python when you fly.
- Quora - Quora also chose Python for its development
- CodesDope - Yes, we also use Python.
- Battlefield 2 - Battlefield 2 uses Python to implement core elements of its gameplay such as score-keeping and team-balancing.
- Instagram - Instagram also uses Python for its backend
- Walt Disney Feature Animation - Walt Disney Feature Animation is also using Python to make their animation production system more efficient in scripting.
- NASA - Johnson Space center uses Python in its Integrated Planning System as the standard scripting language.
- Civilization 4 - The new addition to the legendary strategy game series has all of its inner logic, including AI, implemented in Python.
- YouTube - We all love youtube and and youtube loves using Python
- DropBox - Dropbox allows us to store, sync, and share almost anything using the power of Python.
- Pinterest - Pinterest is a visual discovery tool that allows users to showcase their interests through the posting of pictures.

# Requirement
There are 2 ways to install Python (1) Downloading it in [Python](https://www.python.org/) or (2) Install it thru [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) (<i>suggested so you won't have to think about of installing packages and dependencies as you move forward</i>)

- Install <b>Anaconda Distribution</b>
  - Read [`Anaconda Documentation`](https://enterprise-docs.anaconda.com/en/latest/)
  - After Installation, Find path of Python.exe in the distributed package of Anaconda
  - If you can't find the Python.exe path, try to: (1) Windows> Jupyter> Open File Location (2) Jupyter Notebook> Open File Location. Python exe. should be highlighted from Anaconda Package Folder.
- Install IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
  - You just need to select any of the 2 most favored IDE:
    - Install [`Sublime 3`](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- The `advantage of installing anaconda` is you can install other python packages without going through administration rights. But still you have to ensure these kinds of installation are allowed in your organization. example:
```
  # Conda forge sample:
  conda install -c conda-forge scrapy <-- using anaconda prompt
```
- CMD (Command Prompt)
  - Though beginner should learn how to use Python IDLE, it is also advisable to learn creating python code in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and run it in cmd prompt (for Windows)
```
  # How to run .py file from command prompt
  # Running in command promt path to path
  C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\python.exe C:\Users\YourUserName\Desktop\helloworld.py
  
  # Running in command prompt with change of directory
  cd C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\
  python.exe C:\Users\YourUserName\Desktop\helloworld.py
```
