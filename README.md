# About Python
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Pythonâ€™s principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

# Applications for Python
Python is used successfully in thousands of real-world business applications around the world, including many large and mission critical systems. Although the applications for Python are numerous they can be broadly categorized into:

- Web and Internet Development
- Scientific and Numeric Computing
- Education
- Desktop Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- Software Development

Python is always great because of the ff capabilities:
- Python program runs on any platform (Windows, Mac OSx, Linux) this really gives you an advantage of learning a language and implementing it on any known platforms.
- Python has inbuilt large libray with prebuild and portable functionality also known as [`Python Standard Library`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), easy to learn [`Python Language Reference`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index), and [`Python 3 Documenation`](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- Python can be both dynamically and strongly typed (means it is a type of variable that is interpreted at runtime which mean, in Python, there's no need to define the type of the variable.
